# Gradient Descent Intuition Visualization

A Python script to visually and mathematically understand the concept of **gradient descent**, implemented as part of my ongoing learning in machine learning and AI field.  
This repo demonstrates how core optimization concepts can be understood through both **code and visualization**.

## 🚀 Overview

This script was created after following the **Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng on Coursera** ([Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction)), as part of my journey to transition from full-stack development to **Machine Learning / AI development**.  

Key points:

- **Educational Purpose:** The goal was to develop an **intuitive understanding** of gradient descent, its mathematical and visual parts.  
- **Core Concepts Practiced:** 
  - Gradient computation and application  
  - Iterative solution updates  
  - Learning rate effect on convergence  
  - Visualizing optimization paths on objective functions  
- **Mathematical Foundation:** Reinforces understanding of supervised learning, linear regression, and optimization methods.  
- **Visualization:** Steps of the gradient descent algorithm are plotted alongside randomly sampled points from the objective function to observe convergence.  

This helped me to **translate this mathematical concept into functional code**, bridging my software engineering skills with begginer machine learning knowledge.
